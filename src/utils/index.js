//  here we are importing the (constants) file:
// V.IMP = so basically there are so many ways to (import) and (export) the files.
// V.IMP = it will basically depend on that what we have in the file:
// for-example:if we are importing and exporting the (Constants) file.
// so then instead of importing and exporting it as the normal file.
// we can import and export it in different way or we can say in the (simple) way:

// => this is (simple) way to do it:if we have (multiple) export function in the one (file):
// -> first we import:
// import {API_URL,local_storage_token} from './constants.js';
// -> and then second we export them:
// V.IMP -> like this as an (object) of (multiple-functions):
// export {API_URL,Local_Storage_token};

// => this is (other) way to do it:
// V.IMP = by simply using the (*) asterisk method on the (constants) file and (export) it:
// => (asterisk) =  The asterisk (*) in the context of Reactâ€™s export statement is used to export all the named exports from a module as a single object1. This is useful when you want to group multiple exports from a module into a single object.
// V.IMP = this will basically get all the (exported-function) from the (Constants) file in the (Utils) file:
// and then from the (utils) file we will export them and gave it to the (application):
// IMP = with the help of this method we can (export) all the export-function in (one-line):
export * from "./constants";

// here we are creating the (helper) functionS:
// => first-helper function:
// through which we will store the (token) in the (local-storage) of (user's-Browser) local-storage:
// which we are get from the (server):when (user) successfully get authenticated in our application:
// its basically get stored in the user's browser (local-storage):when (user) successfully get authenticated by the (server):
// we do this because:when user refresh the (app) or it gets refresh by it self:
// then we need that (token) to fetch the (user) data from it:
// IMP = this fucntion basically gets the two arguments in it:
// first is the (key):
// second is the (value):
export const setItemInLocalStorage = (key, value) => {
  // In the function.first we need to add some (ristrictions) or (test-case) to it:
  // so that this function does not get (failed):
  // because its the important function for our application:

  // first-test-case =  Is that.if any of the (argument) related to the function:
  // does not present.then we have to return the (error).In the console-log:
  // this case basically means that we are not getting any-one of the argument.
  // In the funciton.from where this fucntion get triggered:
  if (!key || !value) {
    // we need to print on the console.that we are not able to set the (token) in the (local-storage):
    return console.error("can not store token in LS");
  }

  // but if we get the (both) arguments or we can say there values in this function:
  // then we have to set the (token) to the (local-storage):
  // IMP = how we can store that token-value in hte (local-storage):
  // => first we have to check that.the (value) which we are getting what is the type of that (value):
  // for checking the type of the value.we can use the (typeof) operator or method we can say:
  // IMP = if the value is not in the type of (string).then we have to convert that (data) of the (value) argument:
  // In the form of (string):
  // IMP = for example.if we have the data of (value) argument in the form of (object):
  // then we have to convert that (object) in the form of string:
  // we can do that with the help of (json):because we will get the java-script object:
  // and we can convert that object in the form of (json-string):
  // by using the (json) and its method to convert the (js-object) into the (string):
  // we can use the (stringify) method of the (json) to convert (js-object) into (string):
  // IMP = but if its already in the form of (string):then we can simply use it in our function logic:
  const valueToStore =
    typeof value !== "string" ? JSON.stringify(value) : value;

  // => IMP = after checking the type of the toekn-value or handling the type of the value:
  // we will add token-value in the (localStorage):
  // IMP =  for doing that we have to use the (localStorage) method.
  // and also have to use it function (setItem):
  // we use (setItem).because we want to add the our (value) in the localstorage:
  localStorage.setItem(key, valueToStore);
};

// => second helper function:
// it also same as the (setItemInLocalStorage) function:
// the only difference is that.In this funciton we will get the (value) of the (token):
// from the (LocalStorage):which we have store in the (localStorage) with the help of (setItemInLocalStorage) function:
// IMP = here we just have to access the (item) from the (localStorage):
// that why we are only passing the (one) argument to this function:
// and argument is (key):because we have store our (token-value) in the (localstorage) with that (key):
// so that we can easily access our (token-value) in the localstorage:
export const getItemFromLocalStorage = (key) => {
  // so for getting the (token).from the (localstorage):
  // with the help of (key) argument:
  // we simple have to pass the (key) argument:
  // TO  the (getItem) function of the (localStorage) method:

  // IMP = we also have to add some test cases in fucntion:
  // so that our application did not get crash:
  if(!key){
    return console.error('did not have token in LS');
  }  
  // here we are getting the token-value from the localstorage with the help of (key):
  // IMP = In this function. we have to use the (return) method as well:
  // because this function.also have to provde this value to the other (functions) and (components) as well:
  return localStorage.getItem(key);

};

// => third helper function:
// it also same as the (setItemLocalStorage) function:
// the only difference is that.In this funciton we will basically (remove) the (value) of the (token) from the (LocalStorage):
// we did this only when the user (try-to)  or (already) get (logout) from the application:
export const removeItemFromLocalStorage = (key) =>{

  // we need to add some test-cases in this function:
  // so that our application did not get crash:
  if(!key){
    return console.error('not able to find or remove the token-value from LS')
  }

  // for removing the (token-value) from the local-storage:
  // we have to pass the (key) to the (removeItem) fucntion of the (localStorage) method:
  localStorage.removeItem(key);
  

}

// V.V.IMP = here we are creating the function:
// through which we are converting our (request) body-data in the form of (x-www-form-urlencoded) request:
// so that we can send our (body) data in this (request):

// V.V.IMP = so what does this (function) do:
// for example:if we have a (body) object like this:
// {
// username:'harish',
// password:'12345'
//}
// V.V.IMP = so when we pass this (body) object into this (function):
// it will look like this:
// 'username=harish&password=12345'

// here In this way we can create this function:
// 1 => we will create this function in the form of (arrow-function):and export it:
// 2 => we will also pass it the (params) argument.this params argument is basically a (object):this  (params) argument will basically have the (data) related to our (body):
// because we are passing our (body) to this (Function):
export const getFormBody = (params) => {
  // 3 => under this function:first we  create the empty (formBody) and that is just a (empty-array):
  let formBody = [];

  // 4 => after that we need to loop on the (params) argument:
  // because that will have the (data) related to  (body).
  // which we want to send to the (server) in the (request):
  // IMP = it will have the personal details related to the (user):
  // like (user-name) or (password):
  // so we will getting those both from the (params) by looping on it:

  for (let property in params) {
    // console.log(property);
    // console.log(params[property]);
    // 5 = here we are converting our body-data.In the form of (form-content) type request:
    // so that we can send it into the (request):
    // IMP = In body data we will have the two things:
    // IMP = we will be converting those both the things and store them in the (key) and (value) variable:
    // 1 = (user-name):the (user-name) will be our (key) or (encodeKey) variable:
    // 2 = password):and the (password) will be our (value) or (encodeValue) variable:
    // V.IMp = for converting our body-data into the (form-content)type-request:
    // we have to use the (encodeURIComponent) function:
    // V.IMP = this function basically Encodes a text string as a valid component of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
    // first = we will convert the (name).
    // => if we have user name like this:(harish kumar):
    // then after conversion it will be look like this:(harish%20name):
    let encodeKey = encodeURIComponent(property);
    // second = we will convert the (password):
    // if we have password like this:(harish 123):
    // then after conversion it will be look like this:(harish%2020123)
    let encodeValue = encodeURIComponent(params[property]);

    // 6= now we will push our (key) and (value) into the (formBody) array:
    // V.IMP = before that we have combine them both.and there (values) will be (separated) from each other.
    // with the help of equalsto (=):
    // after combining them.we need to push them into our (formBody) array:
    // we can do that with the help of (push) function:
    formBody.push(encodeKey + "=" + encodeValue);
  }
  // 7 = after getting the (conversion) of our (body-data) in the (formBody) array:
  // we have to (return) that (conversion) from this function:so that our request can have (access) of that (new) body-data:
  // through the body which we are passing our (request):
  // V.V.IMP => before returning that conversion from this function:
  // we have to separate those both the values from each other with the help of (join) function:
  // with the help of (join) function:we can add the (&)  ampersand-sign between those two values:
  // so that they got separated from each other:
  return formBody.join("&"); // 'username=harish&password=12345'
};
