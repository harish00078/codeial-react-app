AUTHENTICATION FIX SUMMARY
==========================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- The "No token provided" error was occurring because posts were being fetched immediately when the app loaded, regardless of user authentication status
- The PostsProvider was wrapping the entire app and fetching posts on mount
- The Home component also had its own useEffect that fetched posts directly

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Modified useProvidePosts hook in src/hooks/index.js:
   - Added authentication check: `if (!auth.user)` before fetching posts
   - Only fetches posts when user is authenticated
   - Returns empty posts array and sets loading to false when not authenticated
   - Added dependency on `auth.user` to re-run when authentication status changes

2. Updated Home component in src/pages/Home-DetailedCode-tillUserProfile-Lecture.js:
   - Removed redundant useEffect that was fetching posts directly
   - Now uses posts from PostsContext via usePosts() hook
   - Eliminates duplicate API calls and authentication bypass

HOW IT WORKS:
1. App loads → PostsProvider initializes but doesn't fetch posts (no user)
2. User navigates to login/signup → No posts fetched, no API errors
3. User logs in → auth.user becomes truthy → PostsProvider fetches posts
4. User logs out → auth.user becomes null → PostsProvider clears posts

BENEFITS:
- Prevents "No token provided" errors on unauthenticated pages
- Centralizes post fetching logic in PostsProvider
- Eliminates redundant API calls
- Maintains proper authentication flow
- UI gracefully handles unauthenticated state

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/hooks/index.js: useProvidePosts hook now checks auth.user
- src/pages/Home-DetailedCode-tillUserProfile-Lecture.js: Uses context instead of direct API calls

TESTING:
- Login page should load without API errors
- Home page should show loading then posts after login
- Logout should clear posts without errors
- No more "No token provided" errors in console
